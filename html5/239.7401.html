Thus, the FAR definition of a commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) item would also cover leasing/provisioning of telecommunications circuits (commoditized bandwidth).</p>

IAW FAR 22.001, a "service contract means any Government contract, or subcontract thereunder, the principal purpose of which is to furnish services in the United States through the use of service employees."</p>
