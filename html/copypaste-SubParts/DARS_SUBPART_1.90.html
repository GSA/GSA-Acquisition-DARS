      <p class="p List1" id="DARS_1.9000__jMsFLF">(i) Legal and Policy Compliance review thresholds. PL8 (non-telecommunications): $10M for task orders, $10M for supplies / hardware, and $6.5M for all other procurement actions; PLA, PL5, PL7 and PL8 (telecommunications): $6.5M for all procurement actions. PL6: $6.5M for Legal reviews, see DARS PGI 1.9000(d)(5) for compliance reviews. All broad agency announcements (BAA) require legal review.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="DARS_1.9000__KHRdCL">(ii) Legal and Policy reviews of contracts and task orders using the trade-off evaluation method, regardless of dollar value, are highly encouraged.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="DARS_1.9000__FkVWQV">Legal and Policy reviews can be requested by a contracting officer, CoCO, HCO, or HCA at lower dollar thresholds or for special interest procurements.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="DARS_1.9000__vsxpmY">(2) At a minimum, the contracting officer must review the contract file/documentation prior to requesting a legal and policy compliance review. Also, the contract file must be reviewed at least one level above the contracting officer prior to requesting a Legal and Policy compliance review for contract actions greater than or equal to $50M. The contracting officer may submit the request for Legal and Policy compliance review only after all reviewer comments, if any, are resolved.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="DARS_1.9000__yCnsdH">(3) Legal and Policy compliance reviews should be requested concurrently. Legal and Policy reviews will be accomplished in four (4) business days. Additional business days may be required to review substantial/numerous documents.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="DARS_1.9000__qMURDJ">(i) When Legal or Policy reviews indicate non-compliance with laws, regulations or policies (e.g., a Policy Finding or a GC legally insufficient finding), the contracting officer will revise the procurement documents in collaboration with the assigned attorney-advisor and/or procurement analyst. Legal will copy the CoCO on e-mails which notify a contracting officer of legally insufficient findings, and Policy will copy the CoCO on e-mails which notify a contracting officer of compliance review Findings. A procurement document shall not be released until legally insufficient or compliance review Findings are adjudicated.</p>
      <p class="p List1" id="DARS_1.9000__YOieJl">(ii) While changes are expected to be professionally resolved at the lowest possible level, disagreements may be elevated above the contracting officer, through Section and Branch Chiefs to the CoCO, the HCO, and ultimately to the HCA.

Pertinent information needed to assist the PL22 Policy compliance reviewers should be included in the body of the e-mail. For example, provide the EDMS folder ID number*, document identifier/description, indicate if a policy compliance review was accomplished at a previous stage of the procurement (and if so, the solicitation number), provide the estimated dollar value of the procurement, etc. See Table 1-5 for a list of required documents<strong class="ph b">.</strong> Documents may be submitted as attachments to the email if not available in EDMS.</p>

Observations may be accompanied by an actionable Recommendation. Examples include process improvements, apparent oversights in supporting documentations or the contents of the contract file, administrative errors related to grammar, punctuation, style, etc.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="DARS_1.9000__qEphpf">(B) Finding: Specific actions that contradict statutory, regulatory, or policy requirements, causing the procurement to be deemed non-compliant with the FAR, DFARS, DARS, or DISA prescribed policy or procedure. Findings shall include a cited reference and the Finding shall be resolved prior to release of any related procurement documents. The compliance review issued by PL22 documenting the Finding and the documented disposition by the Contracting Officer shall be filed in the contract file.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="DARS_1.9000__VTeocV">(C) Recommendation: Tangible action proposed by the Analyst to rectify a Finding identified by the compliance review by either: (1) adjudicating the Finding in accordance with statute, regulation, or policy or (2) establishing internal procedures to mitigate the likelihood of reoccurring deficiencies if elimination of the Finding is not possible or practical.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="DARS_1.9000__rHVfJR">(D) Commendation: Validated procedures, actions or examples with supportable documentation which can generally been accepted as superior to other alternatives, or “standards” over-and-above what is merely required.</p>

PMRs assist the Head of the Contracting Activity (HCA) and the DISA Senior Procurement Executive, in evaluating DISA’s procurement processes, including the DISA Purchase Card Program. PMRs also assist the CoCO and the HCO to improve the operational efficiency and effectiveness of their contracting organizations. This is accomplished through the assessment of internal management controls and acquisition policies and procedures. Additionally, the results of the PMRs are used to assess the Agency’s ability to sustain external scrutiny such as DoD Inspector General (DoDIG) Audits, General Accountability Office (GAO) Audits, external PMRs, and other independent reviews.</p>
