HCOs and CoCOs will establish an internal review, self-inspection
program to review contract files not less than annually to ensure
quality standards are maintained for all procurement actions within
their respective offices, including simplified acquisitions. The

PS8 (non-telecommunications): $10M for task orders, $10M for supplies / hardware, and $6.5M for all other procurement actions; PLA, PS5, PS7 and PS8 (telecommunications): $6.5M for all procurement actions.

All broad agency announcements (BAA) require legal review.</p><p class="p List3">(ii) Legal and Policy reviews of contracts and task orders using the trade-off evaluation method, regardless of dollar value, are highly encouraged.</p><p class="p List3">(iii) Legal and Policy reviews can be requested by a contracting officer, CoCO, HCO, or HCA at lower dollar thresholds or for special interest procurements.</p><p class="p List2">(2) At a minimum, the contracting officer must review the contract file/documentation prior to requesting a legal and policy compliance review. Also, the contract file must be reviewed at least one level above the contracting officer prior to requesting a Legal and Policy compliance review for contract actions greater than or equal to $50M. The contracting officer may submit the request for Legal and Policy compliance review only after all reviewer comments, if any, are resolved.</p><p class="p List2">(3) Legal and Policy compliance reviews should be requested concurrently. Legal and Policy reviews will be accomplished in four (4) business days. Additional business days may be required to review substantial/numerous documents.</p><p class="p List3">(i) When Legal or Policy reviews indicate non-compliance with laws, regulations or policies (e.g., a Policy Finding or a GC legally insufficient finding), the contracting officer will revise the procurement documents in collaboration with the assigned attorney-advisor and/or procurement analyst. Legal will copy the CoCO on e-mails which notify a contracting officer of legally insufficient findings, and Policy will copy the CoCO on e-mails which notify a contracting officer of compliance review Findings. A procurement document shall not be released until legally insufficient or compliance review Findings are adjudicated.</p><p class="p List3">(ii) While changes are expected to be professionally resolved at the lowest possible level, disagreements may be elevated above the contracting officer, through Section and Branch Chiefs to the CoCO, the HCO, and ultimately to the HCA.

Pertinent information needed to assist the PS22 Policy compliance reviewers should be included in the body of the e-mail. For example, provide the EDMS folder ID number*, document identifier/description, indicate if a policy compliance review was accomplished at a previous stage of the procurement (and if so, the solicitation number), provide the estimated dollar value of the procurement, etc. See Table 1-5 for a list of required documents<strong class="ph b">.</strong> Documents may be submitted as attachments to the email if not available in EDMS.</p><p class="p">*Note: The EDMS folder identifier must be included.</p><p class="p List3">(ii) In circumstances where the contracting officer finds it necessary to proceed with issuing a solicitation or awarding a contract action prior to obtaining a PS22 Policy compliance review as required by the DARS, the contracting officer shall obtain a written waiver from the CoCO. The waiver shall be retained in the official contract file. Prior to requesting a waiver, the Contracting Officer shall consider a targeted review of critical documents or portion of the contract file.</p><p class="p List3">(iii) Each Policy review comment will be listed under one of the following categories: Observation, Finding, Recommendation, or Commendation. Below are the definitions of each category:</p><p class="p List4">(A) Observation: Comments and input on issues identified by the
PS22 Analyst that do not meet the definition of a Finding or do not
warrant being documented as a Finding yet may need correction.
Observations may be accompanied by an actionable Recommendation.
Examples include process improvements, apparent oversights in
supporting documentations or the contents of the contract file,
administrative errors related to grammar, punctuation, style,
etc.</p><p class="p List4">(B) Finding: Specific actions that contradict statutory,
regulatory, or policy requirements, causing the procurement to be
deemed non-compliant with the FAR, DFARS, DARS, or DISA prescribed
policy or procedure. Findings shall include a cited reference and
the Finding shall be resolved prior to release of any related
procurement documents. The compliance review issued by PS22
documenting the Finding and the documented disposition by the
Contracting Officer shall be filed in the contract file.</p><p class="p List4">(C) Recommendation: Tangible action proposed by the Analyst to
rectify a Finding identified by the compliance review by either:
(1) adjudicating the Finding in accordance with statute,
regulation, or policy or (2) establishing internal procedures to
mitigate the likelihood of reoccurring deficiencies if elimination
of the Finding is not possible or practical.</p><p class="p List4">(D) Commendation: Validated procedures, actions or examples with
supportable documentation which can generally been accepted as
superior to other alternatives, or “standards”
over-and-above what is merely required.</p><p class="p List2">(5) PS6 Reviews see <a class="xref" href="https://dod365.sharepoint-mil.us/sites/disa-PL2/SitePages/Corporate-Library.aspx" target="_blank">DARS PGI</a> 5801.9000(d)(5).</p><p class="p List2">(6) Legal (GC) reviews ---</p><p class="p List3">(i) Definitions.</p><p class="p">

in support of its reviews beyond the base legal sufficiency
determinations above, to include advice on legal and business risks

which the GC is a partner.</p><p class="p List3">(ii) Legal review comments or a statement that the procurement document has been reviewed and found to be legally sufficient shall be placed in the contract file. The contracting officer is responsible for assuring that all legal comments are adjudicated.</p><p class="p List3">(iii) In circumstances where the contracting officer finds it necessary to proceed with issuing a solicitation or awarding a contract action prior to obtaining a required legal review, the contracting officer shall obtain a written waiver from the CoCO. The waiver shall be retained in the contract file. The CoCO shall request an emergency/or quick turn-around legal review prior to approving a waiver.

Purchase Card Program. PMRs also assist the CoCO and the HCO to
improve the operational efficiency and effectiveness of their
