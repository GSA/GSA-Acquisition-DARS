Information (RFI) or Sources Sought Notice (SSN) as a market
research method (see DARS 5810.001 (S-92)) for:</p>
        <p class="p List2">(1) Procurement actions to increase the ceiling amount of a

        <p class="p">(S-91) Use of a SS notice meets the requirement at FAR 5.201 for
making notices of proposed contract actions, when the SS notice
also includes the information required at FAR 5.207(c)(15) and (16)
and FAR 6.302-1(d)(2). Use of an RFI does not meet the requirements
at FAR 5.207(c)(15), (16) and FAR 6.302-1(d)(2); a separate notice
of proposed contract action is required if a sole source
procurement will result from the requirement described in an
RFI.</p>
