      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">(S-90) Leasing/provisioning of telecommunications circuits
(commoditized bandwidth) is covered under the FAR 2.101
Definitions, Commercial product definition, paragraph (1) in that
it is a utility customarily used by the general public or by
non-governmental entities for purposes other than governmental
purposes, and has been sold, leased, or licensed to the general
public; or, has been offered for sale, lease, or license to the
general public. Thus, the FAR definition of a commercially
available off-the-shelf (COTS) item would also cover
leasing/provisioning of telecommunications circuits (commoditized
bandwidth).</p>
        <p class="p">(S-91) Unless there is an associated service offered with the
telecommunications and that associated service is billed
separately, the leasing/provisioning of the telecommunications
circuit (commoditized bandwidth) is not a "service contract." IAW
FAR 22.001, a "service contract means any Government contract, or
subcontract thereunder, the principal purpose of which is to
furnish services in the United States through the use of service
employees."</p>

      <div class="body conbody">

        <p class="p">(S-90) When acquiring telecommunications services using the
Inquiry/Quote/Order (IQO) process or Communication Service
Authorizations (CSAs), refer to the Procurement Guide for
Telecommunications and the IQO Acquisition Deskbook located at <a class="xref" href="https://www.ditco.disa.mil/" target="_blank">

            </a>.</p>
        <p class="p">(S-91) A CSA modification may be issued unilaterally if an
equitable adjustment in contract/order price or delivery terms has
been agreed upon and documented in advance (e.g., quotation,
completion notice/report, bilateral modification to IDIQ contract).
If an equitable adjustment in contract/order price or delivery
terms has been agreed upon and documented in advance, only the
unilateral CSA modification is required. The contractor shall
acknowledge the modification as required by the contract.</p>
