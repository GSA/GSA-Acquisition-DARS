         <span class="ph autonumber">5827.9001</span> Trademark Rights Under
Government Contracts</h2>
      <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">The FAR and DFARS do not address trademark or service mark
rights, nor is there an official DoD policy on ownership of
trademarks or service marks first used in performance of a
government contract in connection with goods or services delivered
to the Government. Under federal trademark law, trademark rights
generally reside with the entity that controls the nature and
quality of the goods or services that are identified by the
trademark.</p>
        <p class="p">However, in certain cases, it may be in the Government’s
best interest for DISA to own a trademark or service mark first
created under a contract. For example, Government ownership may be
desired for a mark that is to be used exclusively in connection
with a government-controlled service that the contractor manages
for DISA. DISA’s Office of the General Counsel should be
consulted to determine if there is a need to negotiate trademark
ownership rights with the contractor and seek federal trademark
protection on DISA’s behalf by filing an application to
register the trademark or service mark with the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office.</p>
