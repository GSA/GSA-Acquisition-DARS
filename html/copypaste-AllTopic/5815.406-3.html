single award indefinite delivery contracts, when established priced
line items are being ordered and the established pricing was deemed
fair and reasonable in the base contract. The PNM fulfills the

         <p class="p List2">(1) PNMs for actions valued over $10M shall be routed electronically to the Cost and Pricing Branch for review/coordination prior to approval (See <a class="xref" href="https://www.ditco.disa.mil/DitcoContractingTemplates" target="_blank"> 
               <u class="ph u">Contract Document Approval Signature Routing Procedures</u> 
            </a>). Routing to the Cost and Pricing Branch or assigned Contract Price/Cost Analyst is not required when pricing is based on prices/rates are established in base contracts/agreements, when prices are set by law or regulation, or a fair and reasonable price determination can be made by the contracting officer by comparing prices or rates against an existing or previous Government contract where prices are recent and based on an adequately supported fair and reasonable price determination.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) ENs for actions valued over $10M, shall be prepared in collaboration with a DITCO Cost/Price Analyst. The Cost/Price Analyst shall assist the contracting officer in evaluation of the pricing proposal and aid in the development of the pre-negotiation objectives issued as ENs; the Contract Price/Cost Analyst shall also support negotiations and review of the PNM, prior to approval, as requested by the contracting officer.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) In all instances where the Cost and Pricing Branch has provided assistance in development of the PNM—including but not limited to, the evaluation of cost/price proposals and calculation of the Government negotiation position, a copy of the signed/approved PNM shall be provided to the Cost and Pricing Branch Chief via <a class="xref" href="mailto:disa.scott.ditco.mbx.cost-and-pricing-branch-ps42@mail.mil" target="_blank">

The explanation shall contain detailed information on recommendations not achieved and the alternative rationale utilized in the contractor officer’s determination of fair and reasonable pricing.</p>
