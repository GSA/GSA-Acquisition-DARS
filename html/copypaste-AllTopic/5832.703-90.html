or Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation Appropriations, and

budget as submitted to Congress. In these instances, the program
manager shall provide the contracting officer a written statement
(coordinated with J8 (OCFO)) that these funds will be used for the

letter with J8 (OCFO) approval. The new commitment letter shall be
provided to the Contract Specialist/Contracting Officer.</p>
