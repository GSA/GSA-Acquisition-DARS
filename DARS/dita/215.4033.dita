      <p id="oMNCiI" outputclass="Normal">(S-90) Refusal to Provide Data Other than Certified Cost and Pricing Data. Contracting Officers are required to coordinate with the DITCO-Scott, Cost and Pricing Branch (PL842) if a contractor refuses to provide Data Other than Certified Cost and Pricing Data. Refusals to provide this data is considered a “Denial of Requests for Data Other than Certified Cost and Pricing Data” and is reportable to DPC in accordance with DFARS PGI 215.403-3(6) Reporting requirements.

As required, the Cost and Pricing Branch will coordinate on any required determination by the HCA IAW FAR 15.403-3(a)(4).</p>
